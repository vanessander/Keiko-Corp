# Project Brief
Incredibly, Bruno the CEO of Keiko Corp has built the fastest growing tech start up in Silicon Valley, without ever having launched a website. Bruno's marketing team is insisting that they need a website in order to gain the confidence of the potential clients to reach this quarters sales targets.

Bruno has put together a quick Figma mockup to demonstrate the layout and simplistic design they are looking for. Although Bruno did request the website be as immaculate and as impressive as his hair, the design is totally open to interpretation and modification during the first iteration of development.
